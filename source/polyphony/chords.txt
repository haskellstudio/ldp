Chords
---------

A chord, in polyphony, is any harmonic set of usually three or more notes that is heard as if sounding simultaneously. Therefore, a chord is obtained by defining three or more notes, in different voices sounding simultaneously:

Also, what engravers call a chord, is a musical unit in which the notes share vertical baseline, stem, articulation, etc. This grouping 
indicates not only simultaneity, but also the composer's intent to visually group simultaneous notes as a musical event:

In LDP the :token:`chord` element must be understood in this last way, as a musical unit in which the notes share properties. In LDP a chord is just the list of notes that form the chord:

.. rst-class:: bnf-rule
.. productionlist:: *
    chord : (chord `note`*)

Example::

    (score (vers 2.0) (instrument (musicData
        (clef C2)
        (chord (n c4 q)(n e4 q)(n g4 q))    // C major chord
        (chord (n c4 q)(n f4 q)(n a4 q))    // F major chord
        (chord (n b3 q)(n f4 q)(n g4 q))    // G major 7 chord
        (chord (n c4 q)(n e4 q)(n g4 q))    // C major chord
        (barline)
    )))

Chords has some unique characteristics that are different from stacking notes by using different voices.
The first issue is that all the notes in a :token:`chord` element **must be of the same type** (duration) and are **assigned to the same voice**.

The other important issue is that non-note-specific properties that are shared by
all notes in a chord may only occur once, and must occur on the first
note. These include both visual properties like stems/beams and musical
properties like articulations. It does not include true note-grain
properties like cue or color.

For instance, to change the stem direction the :token:`stem` must be included **only** in first note::

    (score (vers 2.0) (instrument (musicData
        (clef G)
        (chord (n c4 q)(n e4 q)(n g4 q))
        (chord (n c4 q (stem down))(n e4 q)(n g4 q))
        (barline)
    )))
