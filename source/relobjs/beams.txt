    beam : (beam `beamId` `beamtype`)
    beamId : integer number
    beamtype : string. See description

    
Beam segments are represented by a string, encoded in the :token:`beamtype` element. The string is formed by concatenation of 1 to 6 characters from the set { + | - | = | f | b }. Each caracter is associated to a beam level: the first character to the first level, the second character to the second level, etc. An the caracters have the following meaning:

  - '+' for *start beam*. It starts a new beam and must be paired with a '-' in another note.
  - '=' for *continue beam*. Must be included in intermediate notes.
  - '-' for *end beam*. It stops a beam started in another note.
  - 'f' for *forward hook*. For specifying a single beam forward hook that only affects the note in which it is defined.
  - 'b' for *backward hook* For specifying a single beam backward hook that only affects the note in which it is defined.

For instance, lets define the beam for the group in following image:

.. image:: ../figures/beams-03.png

The beam will be assigned, arbitrarily, the ID 31. In first note one beam line starts; this is encoded as ``(beam 31 +)``.
In second note the first beam line continues ('='), a second line starts ('+') and has a forward hook ('f'); therefore, the beam in second note will be encoded as ``(beam 31 =+f)``. The third note has two beam lines that continue from previous note; therefore the beam is encoded as
``(beam 31 ==)``. Finally, in the last note the two beams end and there is a backwards hook; therefore ``(beam 31 --b)``. This is the score::

    (score (vers 2.0) (instrument (musicData
        (clef G)
        (n e4 e (beam 31 +))
        (n g4 t (beam 31 =+f))
        (n d4 s (beam 31 ==))
        (n f4 t (beam 31 --b))
        (spacer 30)
        (barline)
    )))

Some more examples::

    (score (vers 2.0) (instrument (musicData
        (clef G)
        //first group
        (n c4 e (beam 17 +))
        (n d4 e (beam 17 =))
        (n e4 e (beam 17 =))
        (n g4 e (beam 17 -))

        //second group
        (n c4 s (beam 18 +f))
        (n d4 e (beam 18 =))
        (n f4 s (beam 18 -b))

        //third group
        (n c4 t (beam 19 ++))
        (n d4 t (beam 19 ==))
        (n e4 t (beam 19 ==))
        (n f4 t (beam 19 --))
    )))

For beams in chords the :token:`beam` element must be placed only in the first note of each chord included in the beam. 
Example, two beamed chords::

    (score (vers 2.0) (instrument (musicData
        (clef G)
        (chord (n e4 e. (beam 31 +)) (n g4 e.) (n c5 e.))
        (chord (n d4 s (beam 31 -b)) (n f4 s) (n a4 s))
    )))

Abbreviated notation (deprecated)
.......................................

LDP also supports an abbreviated syntax for beams in simple lines of music. It consists on marking only the first note of the beamed group with a ``g+`` notation and the last note of the group with a ``g-`` notation. All notes defined between these two will be automatically included in the beam, and the beam segments will be automatically computed based on notes duration. Example::

    (score (vers 2.0) (instrument (musicData
        (clef G)
        (key C)
        (time 2 4)

        //Measure 1
        (n c4 e. g+ v1)
        (n d4 s v1)
        (n e4 e g- v1)
        (n c4 s g+ v1)
        (n d4 s v1)
        (n e4 e g- v1)
        (barline simple)

        //Measure 2
        (n c4 s g+ v1)
        (n d4 e v1)
        (n e4 s g- v1)
        (n c4 s g+ v1)
        (n d4 s v1)
        (n d4 s v1)
        (n e4 s g- v1)
        (barline simple)

        //Measure 3
        (n c4 s g+ v1)
        (n d4 e. g- v1)
        (n c4 t g+ v1)
        (n d4 e v1)
        (n d4 t v1)
        (n e4 s g- v1)
        (barline simple)

        //Measure 4
        (n c4 s g+ v1)
        (n d4 t v1)
        (n d4 t v1)
        (n e4 e g- v1)
        (n c4 s g+ v1)
        (n d4 t v1)
        (n d4 e v1)
        (n e4 t g- v1)
        (barline simple)
    )))
