Time signatures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setting or changing the time signature is done with the :token:`time` element. 
There are several alternatives to represent a time signature, but currently LDP only supports two:

- As two stacked numbers: top and bottom. For simple meters the bottom number represents the note that 
  takes one beat, and the top number represents the number of beats in a measure. For compound meters 
  the bottom number represents the note that takes one-third of a beat, and the top number represents 
  the number of notes to make a beat.
 
- As a symbol: the common and cut time symbols.

    time: {   (time [normal] `topNum` `bottomNum` [`visible`] [`location`])
        :   | (time common [`visible`] [`location`])
        :   | (time cut [`visible`] [`location`]) }
    topNum: integer number
    bottomNum: integer number

Examples::

    (score (vers 2.0) (instrument (musicData
        (time 2 4)(barline)
        (time 6 8)(barline)
        (time 12 8)(barline)
        (time 3 8)(barline)
        (time common)(barline)
        (time cut)(barline)
    )))
