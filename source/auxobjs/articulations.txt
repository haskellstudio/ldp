Accents and articulations
----------------------------

In LDP articulations are represented by an :token:`articulation` element attached normally to a :token:`note` element. 
The :token:`articulation` element defines symbols, such as accents, stress marks and other that are not specific for any particular instrument and that affects how the note should be played. 
Instrument-specific notations are defined by the :token:`technical` element.

The following articulation elements are currently supported in LDP:

.. rst-class:: bnf-rule
.. productionlist:: *
    articulation : { `accentMark` | `stressMark` }


Accents
...........

Accents are normally displayed as a symbol above or below a note or chord:

.. rst-class:: bnf-rule
.. productionlist:: *
    accentMark : (`accentType` [`placement`] `printOptions`* )
    accentType : { accent | legato-duro | marccato | marccato-legato | 
               :   marccato-staccato | mezzo-staccato | staccato | 
               :   staccato-duro | staccatissimo | tenuto }

Example::

    (score (vers 2.0) (instrument (musicData
        (clef G)
        (n e4 q (accent))
        (n c5 q (legato-duro))
        (n e4 q (staccato))
        (barline)
    )))

Stress marks
...............

Stress marks refer to additional accents introduced by Schoenberg' *Suite for piano, Op.25* and other sources for filling the gaps in the traditional accents. They are also displayed as a symbol above or below a note or chord:

.. rst-class:: bnf-rule
.. productionlist:: *
    stressMark : (`stressType` [`placement`] `printOptions`* )
    stressType : { stress | unstress }

Example::

    (score (vers 2.0) (instrument (musicData
        (clef G)
        (n e4 q (stress))(n c5 q (stress))
        (n e4 q (unstress))(n c5 q (unstress))
        (barline)
    )))
