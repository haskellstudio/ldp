.. _element_newSystem:

Forcing a new system
--------------------------

Forces to start a new system after current measure.

.. rst-class:: bnf-rule
.. productionlist:: *
    newSystem : (newSystem)


Example::

    (newSystem)



.. _element_location:

The Location element
--------------------------

The location element is used to specify a displacement of the point at which
an object must be rendered:

.. rst-class:: bnf-rule
.. productionlist:: *
    location : [(dx tenths)] [(dy tenths)]

Element *dx* refers to the horizontal direction and 
element *dy* to the vertical one. For example::

    (dx 40)(dy -30.7)

means that the computed vertical location must be shift by -30.7 tenths and the
horizontal location must be shift by 40 tenths.

The x coordinate increments always to right and y coordinate to bottom.
Displacements can be negative.
